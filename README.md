# smallpaint-rs

After watching [this video](https://youtu.be/cDi-uti2oLQ) I decided to port the code to rust.

The original code comes form this website: https://users.cg.tuwien.ac.at/zsolnai/gfx/smallpaint/

I downloaded the version without a gui (old, no GUI) and copied the file `smallpaint_fixed.cpp`.

The website claims that the code is under MIT License, but I couldn't find a copy of it.
